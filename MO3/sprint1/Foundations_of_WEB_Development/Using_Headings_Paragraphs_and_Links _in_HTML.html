        <a href="https://kireeti-sangala.netlify.app/"><p>My review on Classroom of the elite (anime)
            I dont even know where to start, Classroom of the Elite is not just an anime, its not just a piece of writing. it’s an unforgetable experience. A masterpiece of a show. It is a piece of media that I consumed in one bite even though I tried to take my time and savour it. The premise alone is absolute perfection. A simple school where if you dont perform well, you are expelled. Who would have thought  a human mind can come up with such a masterpiece</p></a>
